Seattle is such a strange place for me to walk through
She communicated with me differently
Spoke to me in silent ambient languages

I couldn’t quite tell if she was having a bad day or 
Just wanted to be left alone
The stillness in her cold, frigid air 
either gave you confounded clarity
Or sent bone-chilling shivers down your spine

Days were an odd time for her
The chaos was lovingly embraced but disruptive
It was never until night 
When she would come out to look at me
She pierced the silence and handed me a mirror, everytime
I didn't know what she wanted me to do with it. 

Leaving was always a strange goodbye
She seemed to be happier 
But in a way that longed for my return

The last time I flew into Seattle was when I realized
The darkness they dread from ground zero 
Is what creates visible beauty from above:
Seattle’s beautiful blend of nature and urban luminescence 
The trees do the same dance they’ve done for hundreds of years 
But in between the branches holding hands is the fire they prance around
The lights that signify life down below 
The wind kisses you hello
And her twinkling lights welcome you home
